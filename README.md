# Reddit Content Saver Pipeline

> A Telegram-triggered n8n workflow that scrapes Reddit posts, analyzes them with AI, and saves structured content ideas to Google Sheets.

---

## Overview

Send a Reddit post URL to a Telegram bot. The pipeline scrapes the post and comments, runs AI analysis for content insights, deduplicates against previously processed links, and logs everything to Google Sheets — all automatically.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Telegram Trigger
Listens for incoming messages on the Reddit Bot Telegram account. The message is expected to contain a Reddit post URL.

### 2. Typing Indicator
Immediately sends a typing indicator back to the user so they know the bot received the message.

### 3. Get row(s) in sheet
Fetches all previously processed Reddit URLs from the Google Sheets pipeline log. This is the source of truth for duplicate detection.

### 4. Dedup Check *(Code Node)*
Extracts the Reddit URL from the Telegram message using regex, then normalizes both the incoming URL and all stored URLs (strips `www.`, lowercases, removes trailing slashes) before comparing. Sets an `is_duplicate` flag.

### 5. Duplicate Branch *(If Node)*
| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Duplicate detected | Sends Telegram message with original submission date and summary → stops |
| New link | Continues to Apify scraping |

### 6. Reddit Scrape *(Apify — Reddit Scraper Lite)*
Runs the [`trudax/reddit-scraper-lite`](https://console.apify.com/actors/oAuCIx3ItNrs2okjQ) actor against the Reddit URL. Scrapes the post and up to 10 comments using a residential proxy.

### 7. Get Dataset Items
Retrieves the results from the completed Apify actor run.

### 8. Extract & Clean Data *(Code Node)*
Restructures the raw Apify output — extracts `post_title`, `post_body`, and `comment_summary_text` into a flat object for downstream use.

### 9. Content Validation *(If Node)*
Checks whether the scraped post has at least a title, body, or comment text.
| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Has content | Continues to AI analysis |
| No content | Sends "No Content Found" Telegram reply → stops |

### 10. AI: Analyze Content *(LangChain + OpenAI)*
Passes the post and comments to an OpenAI GPT model. Analyzes the content for ideas, themes, and insights. A Structured Output Parser enforces a consistent JSON response shape.

### 11. Edit Fields
Maps the AI output into a clean, flat structure ready for Google Sheets ingestion.

### 12. Save to Google Sheets
Appends a new row to the pipeline log with post metadata, AI analysis results, and the source URL.

### 13. Success Confirmation
Sends a Telegram message confirming the post has been saved, with a link to the Google Sheet.
